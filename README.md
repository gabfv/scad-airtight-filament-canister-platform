# scad-airtight-filament-canister-platform
This is project I've made to learn about openSCAD and 3D printing in general!
It is a platform for those airtight filament canisters made by *henryarnold* : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1332650
I basically have my 3D printer ontop of my laundry machine (*No, I don't try to print while doing the laundry! =P*) and since it takes quite a bit of space, I didn't really have any place left for the filament canister. Hence the platform, so I can make something that extends beyond the surface area of the top of my laundry machine without the canister being at an odd angle for the filament or with the PTFE tube being over-extended.
